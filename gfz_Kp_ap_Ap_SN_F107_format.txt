Purpose and general features
============================
This distribution channel of Kp is meant to give experts and non-experts convenient access to Kp and other relevant indices. Latest nowcast and definitive values are used as they become available. The files contain the geomagnetic indices Kp, ap and Ap, the solar indices observed F10.7 (recommended for ionospheric and atmospheric studies), adjusted F10.7 (recommended for solar studies) and sunspot number (version 2.0 introduced in 2015). For more information on F10.7 see Tapping (2013) and on sunspot number see Clette and Lefevre (2016). 

The blank separated ASCII file with fixed format is easy to read in by code or as spreadsheets. The code for missing data is -1. Kp values are given as float with three decimals (e.g. 0.667 instead of 0.7 or 1-). Both the starting time and the mean time of the three-hourly intervals are given since the index represents geomagnetic disturbance over the full three-hour interval. Additionally, a linear time scale in days since January 1st 1932 and the Bartels rotations are given.

Versions with one line per day and with one line per three-hourly interval (only Kp, ap and Ap) are available.

The files containing all data since 1932 and the yearly files are updated daily, while a nowcast file is updated continuously during the day to support near real-time (NRT) operations. The Kp and sunspot number data is a combination of definitive data when available and nowcast data otherwise and regularly updated to replace nowcast with definitive values. For each data point, it is indicated if the values are nowcast or preliminary.


The Kp, ap, and Ap indices
--------------------------
The geomagnetic indices Kp, ap and Ap were introduced by Bartels (1949, 1957) and are produced by Geomagnetic Observatory Niemegk, GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. The values used here are a copy of the definitive values in https://doi.org/10.5880/Kp.0001 as soon as they are available. Before the definitive values become available, nowcast values are given.

Data publication: Matzka et al., (2021b)


International Sunspot Number SN
-------------------------------
The international sunspot number SN (S_{N} or S subscript N) is given as the daily total sunspot number obtained from this source: http://www.sidc.be/silso/DATA/SN_d_tot_V2.0.txt, see http://www.sidc.be/silso/infosndtot,
which is version 2.0 introduced in 2015, see 
http://sidc.be/silso/newdataset
and Clette and Lefevre (2016) 
The most recent data is preliminary and we replace it by the definitive values as soon as they become available. 
The sunspot data is available under the license CC BY-NC 4.0 from WDC-SILSO, Royal Observatory of Belgium, Brussels


F10.7 Solar Radio Flux
----------------------
Local noon-time observed (F10.7obs) and adjusted (F10.7adj) solar radio flux F10.7 at 10.7 cm wavelength in s.f.u. (10^-22 W m^-2 Hz^-1) is provided by Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory and Natural Resources Canada, see Tapping (2013). For ionospheric and atmospheric studies we recommend F10.7obs. Data provided by Natural Resources Canada and regularly updated from: ftp://ftp.seismo.nrcan.gc.ca/spaceweather/solar_flux/daily_flux_values/fluxtable.txt 



Files with one line per day
===========================
Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107*.txt files have one line per UT day and distribute the Kp, ap and Ap index as well as the solar indices SN and F10.7. The time stamp for each line is given as:
- year month day
- Days since 1932-01-01 to indicate the start of the UT day (00:00)
- Days since 1932-01-01 plus 0.5 to indicate the mid of the UT day (12:00)
- Bartels solar rotation number and number of UT day within this rotation

We provide one file that contains all index values since 1932-01-01 named:
Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107_since_1932.txt,
which is updated daily.

We provide yearly files named, e.g., 
Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107_2020.txt, 
which are updated daily.

We provide one nowcast file 
Kp_ap_Ap_SN_F107_nowcast.txt
with data for the previous and current day, which is constantly updated.
