You are more than welcome to include the data in your package. Note that we update the data every 3 hours, but perhaps the work you are doing does not require the very latest data. As long as users do not query more often than once every 3 hours, there should be no problem. And I would recommend using the https://celestrak.com/SpaceData/SW-Last5Years.txt file, since the earlier data in the larger file will not change.

There are no licensing requirements. I would only ask that you include the URL in your documentation so that others might be able to find the data and associated documentation.  - TS
