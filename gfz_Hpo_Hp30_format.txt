# Short file description (for a detailed file description, see Hpo_format.txt):
# 30 header lines, all starting with #
# ASCII, blank separated and fixed length, missing data indicated by -1.000 for Hp30 and -1 for ap30
# YYYY MM DD is date of UT day, hh.h is starting time in hours of interval for which Hp30 and ap30 are given
# hh._m is mid time in hours of interval for which Hp30 and ap30 are given
# days is days since 1932-01-01 00:00 UT to start of interval, days_m is days since 1932-01-01 00:00 UT to mid of interval
# Hp30, ap30
# Currently always D = 0, reserved for future use.
