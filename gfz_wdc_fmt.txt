DOI and licence of the Kp dataset

Data in the kpyymm.wdc files is based on the Kp dataset.
DOI of the Kp dataset: https://doi.org/10.5880/Kp.0001
Kp dataset described in:
Matzka, J., Stolle, C., Yamazaki, Y., Bronkalla, O. and Morschhauser, A.,
2021. The geomagnetic Kp index and derived indices of geomagnetic activity.

Important Note: DOI and reference publications in March 2021

In March 2021, the Kp dataset was published with a DOI and described in a 
publication.




Important Note: Filename Ambiguity in 2020

Since January 2020, the conventional filenames for the Kp index in the WDC
format would have become ambiguous, as Kp2001.wdc could mean a monthly file for
January 2020 or a yearly file for the year 2001. From January 2020, all yearly
files are moved to a subdirectory called 'yearly'. Please find the updated
format description below that takes into account this change.

Despite the fact that each line in these WDC files has its own, correct time
stamp, we noticed that some of our users, depending on how they reformat the
downloaded data files, have produced corrupted files on their side as a
consequence of the filename ambiguity and our mitigation step. 

We recommend our users to check their reformatted files when downloading our WDC
files, especially for the early 2000s and the early months of 2020 and
especially if they are not sure how their downloading and reformatting algorithm
deals with the filename ambiguity. Our other file formats (e.g. *.tab) are not
affected. We recommend using daily files, which are updated at the same time as
the monthly files.




Availability

The most recent kpyymm.wdc (yymm stands for year and month, each expressed by
two digits) files are distributed half-monthly by the email:

     kp_index@gfz-potsdam.de

Both recent and past files since January 2001 (0101) are distributed from the
FTP server:

     ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/wdc/

FROM 2020 ONWARDS: The yearly files kpyyyy.wdc (yyyy stands for year expressed
by four digits) since 1932 are distributed from the FTP server:

     ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/wdc/yearly/

A description of the FTP server, nowcast indices and background information on
geomagnetic indices and the classification of days can be found on the webpage:

Preliminaries

We use a format similar to the standard format previously used by the National
Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado.

Caution:

   * the columns for the solar radio flux (columns 66-71) are not reported from
     2007 onwards
   * the list of most quiet and most disturbed days is not contained in this
     format; if you need those, please refer to the other tables
     (kpyymm.tab)
   * we do not guarantee the correctness of the international sunspot number
     R; these values are published separately (Brussels, Belgium)
   * note that the sunspot number calculation has been changed by WDC-SILSO,
     Royal Observatory of Belgium, on July 2015, affecting sunspot numbers from
     January 2015.
   * sunspot numbers are not reported from 2015 onwards

WDC-Format Description

The missing data symbol for Kp is 99, the missing data symbol for all other
parameters are blanks.

Column  Format  Description
======  ======  ===========
 1- 2     i2    yy, last two digits of year
 3- 4     i2    mm, month (1-12)
 5- 6     i2    dd, day of month (1-31)

 7-10     i4    Bartels solar rotation number - a sequence of 27-day
                  intervals counted continuously from February 8, 1832
11-12     i2    Number of day within the Bartels 27-day cycle

13-28    8i2    3-hourly Kp indices (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15,
                                     15-18, 18-21, 21-24 UT)
29-31     i3    Daily Kp sum rounded to thirds, but Ap instead of the daily sum
                of Kp is recommended for scientific purposes
                (supplied only for tradition, use Ap scientific purposes!)

32-55    8i3    3-hourly ap indices (0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-15,
                                     15-18, 18-21, 21-24 UT)
56-58     i3    Ap equivalent daily amplitude, the arithmetic mean
                  of the day's eight ap values rounded to integer

59-61     f3.1  Cp or Planetary Daily Character Figure - a qualitative estimate
                  of overall level of magnetic activity for the day determined
                  from the sum of the eight ap amplitudes.  Cp ranges, in steps
                  of one-tenth, from 0 (quiet) to 2.5 (highly disturbed)

62-62     i1    C9 - a conversion of the 0 to 2.5 range of the Cp index to one
                  digit between 0 and 9



Note that sunspot number, which was reported by the Kp service until 2014, and 
solar radio flux, which was reported until 2006, are not provided for download
in this WDC-format. These solar indices are provided through the format 
selection 'Geomagnetic and solar indices' on https://kp.gfz-potsdam.de/en/data
